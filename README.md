## Current Status

**Research prototype · Author-labeled synthetic pilot · No independent validation**

CallGate connects live transcription, a deterministic risk policy, evidence inspection, and a separate reviewer flow. It cannot control a phone call or block a real bank transfer. Risk decisions do not use an LLM.

| Area | Implemented today | Boundary |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Speech | Streaming transcription and text fallback | Live text has bounded English/Mandarin/mixed rules; Mandarin streaming ASR is not validated |
| Risk policy | Four states, evidence revisions, deduplicated scoring | Heuristic scores, not fraud probabilities |
| Approval | Scoped, expiring confirmation for one simulated action | Separate role credentials, not enrolled human identities |
| Evidence | Source graph and signed risk receipts | Integrity does not establish judgment correctness |
| Measurement | Local timing, provider timing proxies, bounded SQLite history | No end-to-end SLA or measured infrastructure cost |
| Evaluation | Frozen first-run results, baseline, failure analysis, policy ablations | Small synthetic sample with provisional author labels |

The pilot contains **60 calls: 36 development and 24 initially held out**. The test set has 8 scam, 8 benign and 8 ambiguous calls. It is now revealed and retired from final improvement claims. Expansion to **600 new scenario families is planned, not completed**.

As of 2026-10-05 (America/Los_Angeles), independent reviewer recruitment status: **[owner to fill]**. No new outreach or completed independent annotation was verified in this audit. The old outreach deadlines have passed and are not active commitments. See the [recruitment and scope conditions](evaluation_v1/STEP3_CONDITIONS.md).

### Evaluation disclosure

This evaluation uses synthetic transcripts with provisional labels supplied by the same project assistant that authored the cases and had prior access to the CallGate implementation. Labels were not derived from CallGate predictions. No independent human annotation, adjudication, or inter-rater reliability study has been completed. A frozen holdout limits later tuning exposure but does not establish author independence or real-world validity.

```

Speech contributes evidence; it does not establish identity or grant authority. The trusted application supplies the proposed amount and destination. Transcript changes invalidate pending approval.

The connected reviewer demo now uses a live safety policy with bounded bilingual rules and session-monotone safety categories. Corrected transcript evidence remains inspectable; corrections cannot relax a previously established risk restriction. Start a fresh consented session for a separate test. The archived English engine and frozen pilot remain unchanged; new live behavior is not represented by the old pilot scores.

| State | Meaning in the connected demo |
| :--- | :--- |
| `UNVERIFIED` | No qualifying high-impact request detected; identity remains unverified |
| `CHALLENGED` | The user may request a scoped second confirmation |
| `COOLING_OFF` | High-impact request plus secrecy pressure; approval is unavailable |
| `BLOCKED` | Sensitive credential request; approval is unavailable |

Only **UNVERIFIED (23)** and **CHALLENGED (1)** appeared in the 24-call pilot. COOLING_OFF and BLOCKED have separate fixture tests. VERIFIED_BOUNDED and ESCALATED are earlier design concepts, not implemented Conversation states. Neither BLOCKED nor COOLING_OFF hangs up a call.

## Quick start

Use **Python 3.12** for the recorded dependency set. Node.js is needed only for the frontend logic tests.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cyberchopin/CallGate_PreHackathon_Research.git
cd CallGate_PreHackathon_Research
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate the environment:

| Platform | Command |
| :--- | :--- |
| Windows PowerShell | `./.venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1` |
| macOS / Linux | `source .venv/bin/activate` |

Install the dependencies and start the connected demo:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements-lock.txt -r requirements-verification.txt
python -m scripts.start_review_demo
```

The launcher prints separate participant and reviewer entry links. Default ports are **8766** and **8767**, with fallback ports when occupied. Open the printed links and keep role credentials separate.

**Text input works without an API key.** For microphone transcription, set `ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY` in a local `.env` file. The key stays on the server; do not commit it. The current demo interface uses Chinese guidance with English test speech; this README is English, and the [Chinese local guide](START_HERE.md) is maintained separately.

### Walk through a simulated approval

The launcher now provisions a synthetic saved identity, `saved-family`. Click **读取已登记联系人** and select the identity before requesting a challenge. The request binds that identity to its startup-registered reviewer key; missing or unknown identities have no fallback. The reviewer sees the identity alongside the amount and destination. See [saved-contact verification](docs/CONTACT_VERIFICATION.md) for configuration, trust assumptions and rejection cases.

To rehearse separate family and bank contacts, repeat `--contact-identity saved-family --contact-identity saved-bank` when starting the launcher. Each contact receives a labeled reviewer entry, separate signing key and scoped capability; requests are visible only to their registered addressee. This remains a local synthetic enrollment demo.

The participant page is now framed as an AI assistant checkout surface. The checkout UI is a thin demo skin over the same protected-action, challenge and reviewer paths; it does not add a shopping agent, connect to a merchant or use any payment-network brand. It is labeled as simulated and no real payment can occur.

1. In the participant view, consent to processing fictional test content.
2. Submit “Move your savings into the secure holding wallet.” Stop recording before requesting confirmation.
3. Review the fictional amount and destination, then generate a one-time challenge.
4. Deliver the challenge through a separate agreed channel. In the reviewer view, check the request and approve or deny.
5. Return to the participant view. A successful result explicitly states that only a simulated operation occurred.

To test the refusal path, submit “Tell me your verification code.” The workflow should enter BLOCKED and invalidate pending approval. Start a new session to clear the current conversation and request fresh consent.

## Evaluation

The first-run result exposes a detection weakness rather than a performance advantage.

For the checkout story, run `python -m evaluation_checkout.run` to generate a
small safety-utility rehearsal. It compares deny-all, unguarded checkout and the
CallGate simulated approval path, with raw counts in
`evaluation_checkout/results.json` and a short table in
`evaluation_checkout/REPORT.md`. The same command also writes
`evaluation_checkout/safety_utility.svg` for a pitch slide. This is synthetic
and author-provided; it is not a real shopping metric or independent
evaluation.

| Metric | CallGate | Keyword baseline |
| :--- | ---: | ---: |
| Precision | 100.0% — 1 predicted positive | 40.0% |
| Recall | 12.5% — 1 of 8 scam calls | 25.0% |
| F1 | **22.2%** | **30.8%** |
| False-positive rate | 0.0% — 0 of 8 benign calls | 37.5% |

These metrics use **16 binary-labeled calls**. The other 8 are ambiguous and reported separately; both systems returned negative predictions for all 8. This is not evidence of successful ambiguity detection.

Uncertainty is substantial: CallGate precision has a **95% interval of 20.7%–100%**, and recall **2.2%–47.1%**. Read the [full report](evaluation_v1/pilot_results/REPORT.md) for every interval, denominator and methodological limitation.

Three evaluation-only policy removals produced zero binary-metric delta. The pilot did not exercise the distinguishing credential-block, secrecy-cooling or revision-sensitive sticky behavior. **Zero delta does not establish that those components are ineffective.**

### Reproduce the saved result

```bash
python -m evaluation_v1.evaluate_pilot render
```

This regenerates the report and figures from committed first-run calls, labels, predictions and clock measurements. It verifies the raw archive hash, makes no API calls and does not rerun predictions. Fresh inference has separate input requirements; see the [reproduction guide](evaluation_v1/README.md).

### Run the checks

```bash
python -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider
node --test tests/review_ui.test.cjs
```

Recorded local checks: **184 Python tests and 3 Node logic tests passed**. These counts do not establish real-world accuracy or a green remote CI run. Check [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/Cyberchopin/CallGate_PreHackathon_Research/actions) for remote execution status.

## Security boundaries

### Safety vs Coverage

Authorization safety and warning coverage are different axes. The frozen pilot's recall is low: many scams receive no warning. The action gate still requires separately signed, scoped confirmation; neither transcript content nor a model's confidence grants permission. This safety claim applies only to the controlled simulator, not to a bank app or another device.

A deny-all system can also have no unauthorized executions while helping nobody. Therefore authorization safety must be reported alongside legitimate-request completion rate and verification time. Population-level utility is **not yet measured**. The connected demo's approval tests prove a simulated path exists, not that real people complete it successfully. Prospective evaluation belongs in `evaluation_v2/`; do not tune on its blind annotation inputs.

The direct protected-action endpoint rejects participant input with `POLICY_PROOF_REQUIRED`. This by itself is not superiority over deny-all; the separately verified completion path must also work. Reviewer denial now prevents the same committed operation from receiving a new challenge in that session. Resetting a demo session is not a production anti-abuse boundary.

- **Approval is scoped to a simulation.** No bank, payment provider or telephone control is connected.
- **Role separation is not identity verification.** Someone controlling both entry credentials and the challenge can self-approve. Both processes and their host are trusted.
- **Challenges are bounded.** Three incorrect responses cancel a request. Issuance is limited to five per minute and thirty per hour per workflow process; resets and consent changes do not clear that budget, but a process restart does.
- **Keys and pending approvals are ephemeral.** The demo uses an in-memory replay gate. SQLite replay protection is a separately tested primitive; persistent issuer/reviewer key lifecycle management is not implemented.
- **Receipts attest to signed content.** They do not prove correct risk judgment or human identity, and they are not operation permissions. Authorization replay rejection is a separate mechanism.
- **Consent is a product control.** Withdrawal cancels local provider tasks; it does not delete data already sent to the speech provider or establish legal consent from every speaker.

The local prototype has a trusted-startup saved-contact directory and rejects matching initiator/contact credential origins. It has no independently verified contact enrollment, production tenant isolation, trusted remote deployment or enforcement over real tools. Different configured origins do not prove different humans; an operator holding both role URLs can still approve. Do not expose the demo publicly.

### Optional Sentry observability

Set `CALLGATE_SENTRY_DSN` to enable optional Sentry instrumentation. Without that environment variable, the demo runs with no outbound observability. The code emits privacy-bounded trace/log records for transcript-to-evidence parsing, policy decisions, challenge creation, reviewer decisions and gateway refusals. These records keep session hashes, state names, event types, durations and error codes; transcript text, plain amounts, destinations and contact identities are filtered before any external event is emitted.

Install the optional dependency with `pip install '.[observability]'` in an environment where you intend to send Sentry telemetry. The DSN must stay in the environment and must not be committed. Tests use a fake transport to prove sensitive transcript and checkout fields are absent from emitted records.

<details>
<summary><strong>Receipt verification and measurement retention</strong></summary>

Inspect the evidence graph and export a signed risk receipt from the participant view. Verify it against a public key retained independently from the authenticated receipt-key endpoint:

```bash
python -m scripts.verify_receipt RECEIPT.json --public-key EXPECTED_HEX --session EXPECTED_SESSION
```

Accepting a public key bundled with an untrusted receipt does not establish the issuer. Receipts exclude transcript text but retain a session identifier and metadata; they are not anonymous.

The launcher automatically saves the latest 100 ended-stream measurements in `callgate-metrics.sqlite3`. These records contain numeric timings and fixed outcome labels, not audio, transcript text, challenge codes or session IDs. An unfinished stream may be lost on process crash. Stop the service before removing the database to clear retained metrics. Exported files remain until their owner deletes them.

Failure rate is `failed / (completed + failed)`; cancellations and disconnects are counted separately. Alert percentiles use completed streams with a newly emitted final risk transition and valid timing estimates. Engine measurements use each stream's maximum ingest duration.

Provider connection time, first-transcript wait and local engine time are distinct. First-transcript wait includes speaking, buffering and network time; it is not isolated ASR inference latency. If configured, `CALLGATE_ASR_USD_PER_HOUR` supplies an ASR-only cost estimate. Total infrastructure cost is unmeasured.
