# Public numeric claim registry

Exact numeric README sentences are bound below. Metrics are recomputed from the frozen archive; operational constants are checked against source literals. Dates, identifiers and instruction numbering are explicitly classified as nonmetrics. These source checks do not prove production safety or independent annotation. Historical test counts are checked as historical records, not asserted as current test totals.

Run `python scripts/check_claims.py`. Numeric sentence changes, unregistered digit-bearing lines, archived-evidence edits and inconsistent metric percentages fail closed. Changes to this registry require review; no CI can prevent an authorized person from changing both code and evidence.
